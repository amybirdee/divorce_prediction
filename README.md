Divorce prediction using Gottman survey data

- This project builds machine learning models to predict the likelihood of divorce based on responses to a marital satisfaction survey. The dataset contains 170 responses across 54 psychology-based items that measure aspects of relationship satisfaction, emotional attunement and conflict dynamics

- Despite the small sample size, the data turned out to be highly predictive, allowing multiple models to converge on similar performance metrics and produce stable, interpretable results. The goal of the project was not only to build classifiers, but to understand which aspects of a relationship are most strongly associated with divorce

- The project performs exploratory data analysis on relationship survey responses and goes on to train and evaluate multiple ML models: Logisitic Regression, Random Forest and XG Boost

- The strongest indicators of divorce were breakdowns in shared meaning, future orientation, emotional understanding and conflict regulation.

- The consistency of feature importance across all models suggests that these underlying relational dimensions play a decisive role in long-term marital stability.
